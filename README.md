## Features

### Overview
This service exposes a filesystem directory over HTTP, enabling:
- **File operations**: copy/move, rename, upload, create, delete.
- **Streaming**: browser‑native playback using HTTP 206 partial content. No transcoding, no extra overhead.
- **Access control** via in‑memory hashmap‑based ACLs (read/write/deny per resource and user).
- Detects mount points and adjusts directory type (and icon) accordingly.
- Fast client-side rendering for directory listing.
- Fast directory listing with intelligent caching.
- Fast recursive directory size calculation (disabled by default).

### Multimedia Streaming
- Uses only browser native codecs.
- Custom metadata and subtitle cache to reduce `ffmpeg` calls.
- Switch audio tracks directly in the browser (requires experimental Web Platform Features).
- SSA/ASS subtitle support via `JASSUB` on the client.
- On‑demand SSA/ASS → WebVTT conversion when JASSUB fails or is unavailable.
- Extracts embedded subtitles and chapter data from `.mkv`, `.mp4`, and similar formats.
- Auto‑loads external `.mks` subtitles matching the video basename.

### ACL & User Management
- Managed by `aclmgr.py` in the `scripts/` directory.
- Also accesible from web-console from the endpoint `/srv/console`.
- ACLs define per‑path and per user permissions, read-only, read and write or deny access.
- User accounts stored in JSON, configured via `USERS_FILE`.
- ACL rules stored in JSON, configured via `ACL_FILE`.
- Both files are loaded into RAM as static hashmaps for performance.
- The default user (not logged in) is `DEFAULT`.
- See [aclmgr documentation](scripts/aclmgr.md).


## Setup

### Requirements

#### Server-side
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Install `ffmpeg` at the system level for video playback support.
- A `Redis` server is required for session storage and other caching.

#### Client-side
- The web interface requires a modern browser (2021 or newer).
- If you're using something ancient—like a 2018 relic that hasn’t seen an update in half a decade—expect broken styles and layout quirks.

### Configuration
Configure via environment variables:

| Variable      | Required | Default         | Description                |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| SERVE_PATH    | Yes      | —               | Directory to serve.        |
| ERRLOG_FILE   | No       | data/error.log  | Server error log.          |
| ACL_FILE      | No       | data/acl.json   | ACL rules file.            |
| USERS_FILE    | No       | data/users.json | User accounts file.        |
| SHOW_DIRSIZE  | No       | False           | Display directory sizes.   |
| REDIS_PORT    | No       | 6379            | Redis port.                |
| REDIS_ADDR    | No       | 127.0.0.1       | Redis host address.        |
| SECRET_KEY    | No       | Auto-generated  | Secret key                 |

### Running the Server
**Development** (Flask builtin, `127.0.0.1:8000`):
```bash
python3 app.py
```

**Production** (WSGI, e.g., Gunicorn):
```bash
gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8000 app:app -w $(nproc) -t 900
```

**Extra**
The compress.py script inside scripts dir can be used to minify frontend files and compress the static files.
To use the compression part of the script the brotli tool must be installed systemwide.

### Important
For production always set the SECRET_KEY, otherwise multi-worker setup will break.  
When deploying with Gunicorn, set an appropriate timeout (`-t`).  
For long‑running file operations such as large downloads or uploads, use a timeout of 30 minutes to 2 hours to prevent premature termination.   
When using NGINX as a reverse proxy, disable post‑buffering and increase proxy_read_timeout to ensure long operations are not interrupted.

## Usage

### Endpoints
This server has no general‑purpose endpoints; everything is path‑based with optional query modifiers.  
The entire `/srv/` namespace is reserved for server functionality.  
No part of `/srv/` can be used as a folder name in the root directory.  
Static files are served from `/srv/static`.

#### Authentication
- `GET /srv/login?redirect=encoded_url` → Returns login page, redirecting after successful login or exit.
- `POST /srv/login` → Authenticates using `username` and `password` (form data).
- `GET /srv/logout` → Logs out and ends the current session.

Responses (for API usage):
- `200` → login successful / logout acknowledged.
- `401` → invalid credentials or not logged in.

#### File Access
- `GET /path?get=file` → Always returns the file or its file representation.
  - Regular files: returned directly.
  - Overrides the server’s custom MIME handling.
  - Directories: returned as a TAR archive.
  - Useful for bypassing the player page for audio/video.

- `GET /path?get=static` → Returns the file as a static asset.
  - Applies **only to files**.
  - Overrides the server’s custom MIME handling.
  - Uses the same cache headers as `/srv/static/`.
  - Intended for plugin usage.

#### Video Access
- `GET /videopath?get=info` → Provides chapter data, subtitle track details, and adjacent track filenames as JSON.
- `GET /videopath?get=subs_ssa&id=x` → Returns subtitle track `x` in SSA format.
- `GET /videopath?get=subs_vtt&id=x` → Returns subtitle track `x` in VTT format (legacy).

#### Directory Listings as JSON
- `GET /dir_path?get=json` → Retrieve directory listings in JSON format.
- Works **only for directories**.
- Used mainly on main explorer and plugins.

**Behavior:**
- Results follow the server’s default order.
- Valid `type` values: `disk`, `directory`, `text`, `file`.
- Additional types defined in `app/file_types.json`.

**Example response for `/`:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "media",
    "type": "directory",
    "mtime": 1750592302.2184954,
    "size": 0
  },
  {
    "name": "something.txt",
    "type": "text",
    "mtime": 1750589251.4473305,
    "size": 9823
  },
  {
    "name": "STORAGE",
    "type": "disk",
    "capacity": 2147483648000,
    "size": 509872014832
  }
]
```

### Other HTTP Methods
The server internally uses a subset of WebDAV methods for file/folder operations.  
**Note:** This is not full WebDAV support—these methods are used internally only.
**Note:** Destination header must be always URL encoded in order to support UTF8

| Method | Action performed           |
|--------|----------------------------|
| DELETE | Delete a file or folder    |
| MKCOL  | Create a new folder        |
| MOVE   | Rename or move an item     |
| COPY   | Duplicate a file or folder |
| PUT    | Upload a file              |

### HTML vs .web Extensions
- `.html` files are treated as plain text.
- `.web` files are recognized as HTML pages.
- Placing `index.web` in any folder auto‑loads that page instead of the default listing.
- Disable with `?get=default` to show the file listing page.

### Official Plugins
Plugins allow creation of new pages and customization of the frontend GUI by dropping `.web` extensions into served directories.
